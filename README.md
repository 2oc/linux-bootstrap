Linux Bootstrap
===============

The purpose of this script is to provision a new machine running a fresh install of Ubuntu or other Debian-type Linux system. It includes the software, dotfiles, and general preference I use for web development. The command line environment is based on zsh, vim and tmux. This setup is intended for a personal development machine, not a web-facing server.

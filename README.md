# My Dotfiles

These days everyone publishes their dotfiles. For this I am grateful since I've learned quite a bit by combing through the dotfiles of others. I've tried to gather the things that I find useful while at the same time keeping my own dotfiles as simple as possible.

These dotfiles are mainly intended for my personal use; I've made no attempt to ensure that they are compatible with other systems. Feel free to take what you like and customize it for your own use.

### My System

* OS X (10.9)
* rbenv
* Vim
* tmux
* zsh (oh my zsh)

### Setup Instructions (OS X only)

Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

Install [`oh-my-zsh`](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). (Run `brew install wget` first if needed.)

    wget --no-check-certificate http://install.ohmyz.sh -O - | sh

Close and reopen terminal to complete `oh-my-zsh` install.

Clone this repo.

    git clone https://github.com/joshukraine/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

Symlink the rc files. (Yes, someday when I grow up I'll put this in a Rake task.)

    ln -nfs ~/.dotfiles/gemrc ~/.gemrc
    ln -nfs ~/.dotfiles/gitignore ~/.gitignore_global
    ln -nfs ~/.dotfiles/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
    ln -nfs ~/.dotfiles/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
    ln -nfs ~/.dotfiles/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
    ln -nfs ~/.dotfiles/vim ~/.vim
    ln -nfs ~/.dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -nfs ~/.dotfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc

If you plan to use [Powerline](https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/overview.html#installation), install `python` and THEN `vim`. Order is important. (For more detailed instructions on Powerline, see [How to install Powerline on OS X](https://gist.github.com/joshukraine/2c0078b9eba270382d58).)

    brew install python
    brew install vim --env-std --override-system-vim

Provision your machine with [thoughtbot's laptop script](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop). ([see requirements](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop#requirements))

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/laptop/master/mac)

Set up the `~/.vim/bundle` directory needed by the [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) plugin manager.

    git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    
Set up a `~/.tmp` directory (needed by `vim`)

    mkdir ~/.tmp

Install and configure Powerline: [How to install Powerline on OS X](https://gist.github.com/joshukraine/2c0078b9eba270382d58)

Install `vim` plugins with [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim).

    vim +PluginInstall +qall

### Notes

* In case you're not me, you'll want to add your own name and email to `~/.dotfiles/gitconfig`.
* If you don't want to use Powerline, simply comment out the relevant lines in the vimrc file.
* I use the [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) color scheme (dark) for terminal and `vim`.
* I use the [Inconsolata font](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html), which you can get optimized for Powerline here: https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts
